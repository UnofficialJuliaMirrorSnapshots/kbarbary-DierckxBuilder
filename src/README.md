ddierckx is a 'real*8' version of [dierckx](http://www.netlib.org/dierckx/)
from NETLIB, written by P. Dierckx. The real*8 version was generated
by Pearu Peterson <pearu@ioc.ee> and included in scipy.interpolate.
Note that the real*8 version also includes some modifications in
functionality, such as an extra `ext` argument in curfit that controls
out-of-bounds behavior.
